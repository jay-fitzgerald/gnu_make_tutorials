# Pattern-specific variables are target-specific variables which apply to targets matching a pattern.
# See the static_pattern_rules tutorial for an intro to target patterns.
############################ Example Make Code ############################

# Syntax - target_patterns â€¦ : variable-assignment
# A target-specific variable value is created for each matching member of the target list individually.

# If a target matches more than one pattern, the variables with longer target pattern stems are interpreted first.
# This results in values for more specific patterns taking precedence over the more generic ones.
t1%: cool_var:=No# Takes precedence over an inherited value
%_ps_var_t1: cool_var:=The one with the shortest stem.# A regular ts variable (no stem) would take precedence over this.
demo%: cool_var:=There was only one matching pattern.
%r_t3: cool_var:=Stem lengths were the same, so the last one in the file.
